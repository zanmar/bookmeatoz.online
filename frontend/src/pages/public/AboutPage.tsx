          <p className="text-sm xs:text-base sm:text-base text-neutral-dark leading-relaxed mb-3 xs:mb-3 sm:mb-4">
            BookMeAtOz was born from the observation that many businesses, especially small to medium-sized ones, struggle with 
            inefficient booking systems, missed appointments, and the administrative overhead of manual scheduling. 
            We envisioned a solution that leverages technology to automate these processes, enhance customer convenience, 
            and provide valuable insights to business owners.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm xs:text-base sm:text-base text-neutral-dark leading-relaxed">
            Our journey started with a small team of passionate developers and business strategists dedicated to creating a 
            user-centric platform. After months of research, design, and development, BookMeAtOz emerged as a comprehensive 
            tool designed to be both powerful for businesses and incredibly easy for their clients to use.
